# AI Agent with Tool Integration

A TypeScript-based AI agent that can interact with various tools including Reddit posts fetching, dad jokes generation, and DALL-E image generation.

## Features

- ðŸ¤– GPT-4 powered AI assistant
- ðŸ”§ Modular tool system
- ðŸŽ¨ DALL-E image generation
- ðŸ“± Reddit post fetching
- ðŸ˜„ Dad joke generation
- ðŸ’¾ Conversation memory persistence

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- OpenAI API key
- TypeScript

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

## Usage

Run the agent with a message: âŒ˜K to generate a command
For the code present, we get this error:

```
Parameter 'child' implicitly has an 'any' type.
```

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

To fix the TypeScript error, we need to define the type for the child parameter in the map function. Here's the concise fix:
reddit.ts
.
This adds type information for the child parameter, matching the structure you're accessing in the mapping function. The error occurs because TypeScript can't infer the type of the Reddit API response automatically.
Alternatively, you could create a separate interface for the Reddit response structure, but this inline solution is more concise for your current usage.
where does dquote> come from in the terminal

The dquote> prompt in the terminal typically appears when you've typed an opening double quote (") but haven't closed it yet. It's the shell's way of indicating that you're in the middle of a quoted string and it's waiting for the closing quote.
For example:
Bash
"
To resolve this:

1. Either complete the quote by typing the closing "
   Or press Ctrl+C to cancel the current command
   This is a feature of shells like bash and zsh to help with multi-line quoted strings.
